<p>Library devices use Deep Freeze to restrict data from being saved to the hard drive, meaning that <strong>all work and downloaded software will be deleted</strong> when the device is shut down. Students must save any work to a cloud-based service (like datahub) or an external drive.</p>

Students can find Data Peers on the 1st floor of Moffitt Library. Hours and consulting topics are available at <a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/education/datapeers">https://data.berkeley.edu/education/datapeers</a>.</p>
