# Requesting Deployment Help

Not every instructor has the coding and math experience to feel confident facilitating a module on their own. As an instructor, you can get assistance with one or more of the following roles.

### Student Presenters

For modules that are presented in front of a class as a lecture, demonstration, or discussion, DSEP student team members (often those from the team that developed your module) can act as facilitators.

While the student team members are proficient with coding and statistics, they may not have the domain expertise needed to explain finer details of the data or how it relates to other course content. In the past, many modules have benefitted from having a course instructor, GSI, or TA in the room for input on conceptual questions.

### Lab Assistants

During a modules presentation or lab, students may have technical issues or questions that aren’t appropriate for the full class. To address these issues without interrupting the presentation, DSEP lab assistants can attend the presentation to support students one-on-one. For an interactive module presentation, DSEP typically recommends one lab assistant for every ten students, although the amount of help needed will be different depending on the experience level of your students and the amount of coding in the module.

### Office Hours

For modules with specialized topics or a large number of students, DSEP may be able to hold module-specific office hours. For more information on module office hours or to request module office hour staffing, please contact [Eric Van Dusen](mailto:ericvd@berkeley.edu).
