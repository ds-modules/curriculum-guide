# datascience package

## What is the datascience package?

The `datascience` Python package was written for use in Berkeley’s Data Science courses and contains useful functionality for investigating and graphically displaying data. One key component of the `datascience` package is the Tables abstraction, which is similar to a Pandas dataframe. The aim of this package is to provide a simple but powerful set of tools to introductory students.

## Are students familiar with this package?

Yes! Students who are in Data 8 or have taken Data 8 will use this package extensively in the course.

## Documentation

There is detailed [documentation](http://data8.org/datascience/\) available on Tables, Maps, and other components of the `datascience` package.
