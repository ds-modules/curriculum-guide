# Creating Accessible Notebook Experience

Improving accessibility of the notebook experience has been a priority for the Datahub and Modules team. Datahub Infrastructure team is constantly looking to Jupyter developers for accessibility updpates to both the Jupyter Notebook and Lab experience.We recommend instructors to try Lab 4 and Notebook 7 as part of their instructional workflow given the latest accessibility improvements. Lab 4 has been tested with Data 100 summer 23 instructors and the overall experience has been good except for real time collaboration package.

Number of accessibility improvements have been made in JupyterLab 4.0, including improved screen reader and keyboard navigation, more ARIA roles and labels, and a hamburger menu that collapses if there is not enough space to display all items. You can read more about the features of Lab 4 in this blogpost [here](https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyterlab-4-0-is-here-388d05e03442). We deployed the latest lab 4.0 release to a JL4 hub for Data100, which is one of the cutting edge educational Jupyterhub deployments with the latest packages. 

Reusable components from Jupyter Lab 4.0 were used to build Jupyter Notebook 7.0 which will be the default notebook interface replacing classic notebook and retro notebook in the future. Accessibility improvements from Lab 4.0 will get added to notebook 7.0.
