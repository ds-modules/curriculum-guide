# Creating Accessible Notebook Experience

Improving accessibility of the notebook experience has been a priority for the Datahub and Modules team. Datahub Infrastructure team is constantly looking to Jupyter developers for accessibility updates to both the Jupyter Notebook and Lab experience. We recommend instructors to try Lab 4 and Notebook 7 as part of their instructional workflow given the latest accessibility improvements that were made to these releases. Lab 4 has been tested as part of a new hub with Data 100 summer 23 instructors and the overall experience has been good except for using real time collaboration.

Number of accessibility improvements have been made in JupyterLab 4.0, including improved screen reader and keyboard navigation, more ARIA roles and labels, and a hamburger menu that collapses if there is not enough space to display all items. You can read more about the features of Lab 4 in this blogpost [here](https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyterlab-4-0-is-here-388d05e03442).

Reusable components from Jupyter Lab 4.0 were used to build Jupyter Notebook 7.0 which will be the default notebook interface replacing classic notebook and retro notebook in the future. Accessibility improvements from Lab 4.0 will get added to notebook 7.0.

The other aspect of providing accessible notebook experience involves creating accessible notebook experiences by following the best practices. Couple of resources from [Iota School](https://github.com/Iota-School) that will help you in creating accessible notebook experience is listed below,
