# Launch Jupyter Notebooks using RetroLab interface

RetroLab is an alternative JupyterLab distribution, built from the ground-up, providing a notebook interface with a retro look and feel. RetroLab provides the 
retro interface similar to Classic Notebooks while retaining some of the advanced features from JupyterLab which includes extensions/plugins. 

```{note}
RetroLab project is no longer supported in Datahub as it has reached its EOL and is no longer maintained.
