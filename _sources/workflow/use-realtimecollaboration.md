# Enabling Real Time Collaboration feature in Datahub

[Real-Time Collaboration in Jupyter](https://github.com/jupyterlab/rtc) is one of the most requested functionalities, which has also proven to be a complex use case to develop. However, due to the [generous contribution](https://github.com/jupyterlab/rtc/graphs/contributors) from various open-source contributors, this experimental functionality is currently enabled in Stat 159 hub.  A little bit of context about RTC, This was previously deployed as part of Stat 159 hub during Spring 22. However, we found [severe data corruption issues](https://github.com/berkeley-dsep-infra/datahub/pull/3287) which led to disabling RTC. Fixes to data corruption issues were made as part of the [Jupyter Lab 3.6.1](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/releases/tag/v3.6.1) release. The current implementation is bleeding edge requiring the latest versions of several major Jupyter components but is also prone to many users running into stability and security issues. These issues have been communicated to the Jupyter developer team upstream.

If you are interested in enabling RTC functionality in the hubs you use for instruction, contact the hub admins. Please do keep in mind that you are deploying an early-stage version of RTC and are open to the possibility that hub stability and/or data integrity could get impacted by this decision.


### Data considerations for adopting RTC!

- User notebooks got corrupted in RTC hosted hub. [Ref](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/issues/14031). 
One helpful tip from Fernando Perez piloting RTC in Stat 159 course is to not keep more than one tab from the same browser open parallel. This is particularly problematic in the event of a server restart, as it is the main trigger of the document duplication bug. This issue has been reported upstream and might get fixed as part of the JupyterLab 3.6.2 release.

### Security considerations for adopting RTC!

- If a user shares a link with another user, They can modify all the files in the owner's home directory for the specific hub, including other assignments and homework.
- When a user who owns the notebook stops the server, then the validity of the shared link expires - either explicitly from the control panel or after non-activity for 60 minutes.
- There is no option for the notebook owner to revoke the link, but they can stop the server, which makes the shared link invalid.
- Anyone can forward the generated link to the next person as there is no link-level user control. Users would have to be careful where they share links while that server is active since anyone on the internet could gain control.
- An user who has access to the shared link needs to leave the current session to go and work on their files.

You can start collaborating with others by following the below steps,

### Step 1

Open your IPython (ipynb) notebook files in Jupyter Lab interface. If you are unsure how to generate a nbgitpuller link to access your notebook in Jupyter Lab or Retro Lab interfaces, Please install this [plugin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/nbgitpuller-link-generator/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search) in the Mozilla Firefox browser, which will walk you through the steps required to generate the link for the file easily.

```{note}
Please do keep in mind that Real-Time Collaboration(RTC) functionality is not enabled in classic notebook and retro lab interfaces!
```

### Step 2
As a next step, Generate the shareable link to be shared with your collaborators. Follow the below steps to generate this link,
- In the Menu bar, Click on the Share option (option next to Help). 
- Select "Share Jupyter Server Link" which opens a prompt a the centre of the screen that shows an option to copy the shareable link. 
- Select "Copy Link" option which copies the link to your clipboard

:name: Shareable Link

Here is how you can generate a shareable link
```

### Step 3
Share this link with your collaborators. They will be able to access your notebooks immediately and make edits to the notebook in real-tim
You can also see the cursors from other users with an anonymous username, a username that will disappear in a few seconds to make room for what is essential, the documentâ€™s content.
