Certain courses require instructors/students to convert their Jupyter notebook into a PDF and upload it in gradescope for manual grading. The recommended way to download your Jupyter Notebook (as PDF) is to download via option "PDF via HTML".

We recommend not using the option "Download as Latex" as that has historically led to 500 server errors for a few instructors (like [this](https://github.com/berkeley-dsep-infra/datahub/issues/2664)).
