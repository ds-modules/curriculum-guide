# Launching notebooks using VSCode

### Step 1: Generate nbgitpuller links to launch VSCode

Access the ngbitpuller link generator website using this [link](https://jupyterhub.github.io/nbgitpuller/link) and fill in the following details,
- Enter https://eecs.datahub.berkeley.edu as the JupyterHub URL.
- Enter the name of your Git repository which contains the ipynb files as "Git Repository URL". Your github repository name in the example shown as part of the snapshot would be "Data88-SP22".

:name: nbgitpuller link to launch VSCode

Here is how you can generate a link to launch VSCode in EECS Hub
```

- Enter the name of the branch for your git repository in the "branch" field.
- Ignore the "File To Open" field.

```{note}
VSCode editor will not launch the exact file you file entered as part of the "File To Open" field. It would rather point to the directory which contains all the files stored in your source git repository.
```

- Enter Custom URL as "vscode/?folder=/home/jovyan/<Name_Of_Repository>" For "Application to Open" field.
- Copy the unique link that is generated by nbgitpuller link generator and paste it into your browser. VSCode editor gets launched in the browser showing the contents from the source repository.

```{note}
VSCode editor is currently configured only for EECS Hub and Data 8x Hub. If you want to explore this option as part of other hubs then please do raise a [github issue](https://github.com/berkeley-dsep-infra/datahub/issues/new?assignees=balajialg&labels=type%3A+enhancement&template=featurerequest.md)

### Step 2: Configure VSCode to execute notebooks using python extensions

- Find the python notebook file (.ipynb) that you want to launch in VSCode editor.
- Execute the cell which contains the code to install python packages
- If incase you are not able to run a particular cell, check if the python extension is pre-installed. 
- If it is not installed, Search "python" in the extension list and install the "ms-python" extension directly or click this [link](https://open-vsx.org/extension/ms-python/python) to install the python extension.
- In addition, Search "Jupyter" in the extension list and install the "ms-toolsai.jupyter" extension directly or click this [link](https://open-vsx.org/extension/ms-toolsai/jupyter) to install the Jupyter notebook extension.

# Step 3: Configure VSCode to work with Otter grader

- Complete steps 1 and 2 and run the code installing otter grader. 
If you run into issues with otter grader then do pip install otter-grader before you execute this cell again.
