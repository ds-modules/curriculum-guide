# Launching notebooks using VSCode

# Step 1: Generate nbgitpuller links to launch via vscode editor

Access ngbitpuller link generator website using this [link](https://jupyterhub.github.io/nbgitpuller/link) and fill the following details,
- Enter https://eecs.datahub.berkeley.edu as the JupyterHub URL.
- Enter your Git repository which contains the ipynb files as "Git Repository URL".
- Enter the name of the branch for your git repository in the "branch" field.
- Ignore the field "File To Open" field.
- Enter Custom URL as "vscode/?folder=/home/jovyan/<Name_Of_Repository>" For "Application to Open" field.
- Copy the unique link that is generated by nbgitpuller link generator and paste it in your browser. VSCode editor gets launched in the browser showing the contents from the source repository.

-- Add details related to name of the repository

```{note}
VSCode editor will not launch the exact file you file entered as part of the "File To Open" field. It would rather point to the directory which contains all the files stored in your source git repository.
```

```{note}
VSCode editor is currently configured only for EECS Hub and Data 8x Hub. If you want to explore this option as part of other hubs then please do raise a [github issue](https://github.com/berkeley-dsep-infra/datahub/issues/new?assignees=balajialg&labels=type%3A+enhancement&template=featurerequest.md)

Here is how you can generate a link to launch VSCode in EECS Hub

# Step 2: Configure VSCode to launch notebooks with python extensions preinstalled

- Find the python notebook file (ipynb) that you want to launch in vscode editor.
- Execute the cell which contains the code to install python packages
- Incase if you are not able to run a particular cell, check if python extension is pre-installed. 
- If it is not installed, Search "python" in the extension list and install "ms-python" extension directly or click this [link](https://open-vsx.org/extension/ms-python/python) to install the python extension.
- In addition, Search "Jupyter" in the extension list and install "ms-toolsai.jupyter" extension directly or click this [link](https://open-vsx.org/extension/ms-toolsai/jupyter) to install the Jupyter notebook extension.

# Step 3: Run Otter grader in VSCode

For installing Otter grader, there are no extra steps. Ensure that once you complete the step 1 and 2 run the code containing otter grader. If you run into issues with otter grader then do pip install otter-grader before you execute the cell again.
