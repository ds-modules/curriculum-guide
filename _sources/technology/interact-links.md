# nbgitpuller Links

## What are interact links?

nbgitpuller links simplify the assignment distribution process. Rather than downloading files from an external source and then uploading to their personal JupyterHub accounts, users can obtain all files for a given assignment with just one click. When a user clicks on an interact link for a particular assignment, all files for the assignment will show up in the user's personal JupyterHub account.

## Restrictions

To use an interact link, files must be stored in a public GitHub repo. Currently, interact links are only supported for certain repositories. You can either store content in one of the allowed repositories or contact us on Piazza to add your repository to the list of approved ones. In the future, we will provide automatic interact link support for all repositories.

## Components

Here is an interact link with the various components highlighted in different colors. The grey portions of the link are needed for formatting and will remain the same for each links. The colored portions will be different for each link. If you are new to GitHub you may want to familiarize yourself with the basics \(repositories, branches, etc.\) to better understand each component.

## nbgitpuller Link Generator

nbgitpuller links can be manually created in the format shown above, or can be automatically generated using [this](https://jupyterhub.github.io/nbgitpuller/link.html) tool. The interact link generator tool allows users to specify a JupyterHub URL and GitHub url as inputs. The tool will generate an interact link for the specified GitHub content and JupyterHub.

For example, to pull [this](https://github.com/data-8/mcb-88-connector/tree/gh-pages/exercises/lab5) folder into a JupyterHub account on datahub.berkeley.edu, select "datahub.berkeley.edu" as the desired hub, paste the GitHub url "[https://github.com/data-8/mcb-88-connector/tree/gh-pages/exercises/lab5](https://github.com/data-8/mcb-88-connector/tree/gh-pages/exercises/lab5)" into the generator, and hit the convert button. The output should be "[https://datahub.berkeley.edu/user-redirect/interact?account=data-8&repo=mcb-88-connector&branch=gh-pages&path=exercises/lab5](https://datahub.berkeley.edu/user-redirect/interact?account=data-8&repo=mcb-88-connector&branch=gh-pages&path=exercises/lab5)". This link will copy the desired folder into JupyterHub.
