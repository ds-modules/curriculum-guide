# Resources For Students

Students taking a course with a data science component may need extra resources in order to be successful. In this section, we provide information and links to connect students with computers and in-person help.

### Laptop Lending

- Students who need access to a computer can borrow a Chromebook from Moffitt Library for the entire semester. You can read more about this program [here](https://cdss.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs/data-science-chromebooks-program).
- The Student Technology Equity Program (STEP)(https://studenttech.berkeley.edu/step) provides need-based loans of technology hardware to graduate, professional and undergraduate students at UC Berkeley.
