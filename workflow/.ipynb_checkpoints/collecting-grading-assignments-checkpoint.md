# Collecting and Grading Assignments

We recommend using [Otter Grader](https://otter-grader.readthedocs.io/) for assignment submission and grading. Otter Grader's documentation is extensive but if you still have any queries/issues you can reach out to the team either by creating a [github issue](https://github.com/ucbds-infra/otter-grader) or by joining their [slack channel](https://otter-grader.slack.com/)
