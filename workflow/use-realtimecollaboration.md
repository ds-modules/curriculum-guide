# Using Real Time Collaboration feature in Datahub

[Real-Time Collaboration in Jupyter](https://github.com/jupyterlab/rtc) is one of the most requested functionalities, which has also proven to be a complex use case to develop. However, due to the [generous contribution](https://github.com/jupyterlab/rtc/graphs/contributors) from various open-source contributors, this experimental functionality is enabled in a few hubs (Data 8 and D-Lab at the time of write-up). So, if you are interested in enabling this functionality in your respective hub, please check with the hub admins. 

After that, You can start collaborating with others by following the below steps,

# Step 1

Open your IPython (ipynb) notebook files in Jupyter Lab or Retro Lab interface. If you are unsure how to generate a nbgitpuller link to access your notebook in Jupyter Lab or Retro Lab interfaces, please install this [plugin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/nbgitpuller-link-generator/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=search) in the Mozilla Firefox browser, which will walk you through the steps required to generate these links easily.

# Step 2
As a next step, Generate the shareable link that gets shared with your collaborators. Collaborators can use the link to access your notebooks in real time.

Here is how you can generate a shareable link
```

# Step 3
Once you create the shareable link, Share this link with your collaborators. They will be able to access your notebooks immediately and view or make edits to the notebook in real-time.
